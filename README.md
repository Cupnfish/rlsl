Experimental rust compiler from `MIR` -> `SPIR-V`.

## What is Rlsl?
Rlsl can compile a subset of Rust to [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/). You can read more about the limitations [here](https://github.com/MaikKlein/rlsl/wiki/Limitations).

## How?

```
RUSTC=rlsl cargo build
```

### Contribute

The project currently does not accept any contributions yet.

* Rlsl can not be easily built by anyone
* There is no documentation
* Debugging tools are almost non existent
* There is no infrastructure for testing
* No guide level explanation for contributions

Rlsl will start to accept contributions after those issues are properly addressed.
